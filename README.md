## Implementation Summary
1. Data fetch from an open api for cocktails
2. Local storage funcitonality for open api cocktail data
3. Tasks todo fetch, add, update and delete

## Limitations
1. I encountered firebase database permission issues while trying to access the configured firestore, so i resorted to using my own sample firebase project.


Thank you.
